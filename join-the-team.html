                <p>We’re committed to a digital-first strategy, and in order to
                achieve this, we’re expanding our team of developers.</p>

                    <p>We need people who love a challenge and are willing
                    to successfully take on difficult tasks, contribute to
                    their team and learn on the job. Our engineers enjoy
                    learning and sharing what they learn and they get to
                    work on some unique challenges.</p> <p>We work in
                    cross-functional agile teams that we trust to take on the
                    problems and objectives that they are given. All
                    development is based in London in the same offices as
                    our journalists and editors.</p>

            <p>The Guardian aims to ensure that all job applicants are treated fairly regardless of race (which includes nationality and ethnic or national origin), disability, sex, gender re-assignment, marital or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, perceived or actual age, maternity, pregnancy and religion or belief.</p>

            <p>Some of the benefits that the Guardian can provide for employees include annual season ticket loan, childcare assistance vouchers, cycle to work scheme, gym membership and holiday purchase scheme. We also have a Pension scheme and some of our team work flexible hours - this is agreed on a case by case basis.</p>

                                    <h3>Software Engineer - tools, automation, process</h3>
                                    <p>Guardian News & Media Ltd. is seeking a technical, motivated and open minded colleague to join our highly respected, but relaxed Digital Development team as a Software Engineer - tools, automation, process.  You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the culture of a product team, and in embedding quality throughout the whole process of software development. As well as leading the development of innovative automated solutions to improve our products’ quality, you’ll be finding and researching new techniques and tools and leading discussion with the team about how and where we can use them</p> <p>We are not looking for someone whose ambition is to spend vast amounts of time creating and maintaining automated UI tests. We are looking someone who is excited at the prospect of getting the whole team thinking about quality, by suggesting and developing automated solutions and tooling to facilitate this, but also about having the time to think more creatively about things that might influence the quality of our products. Here at the Guardian we are redefining the traditional approach to QA: relying less on traditional manual and automated UI testing processes; instead ensuring overall product quality through improving automation, tooling, and process - within an agile team operating under rapid deployment cycles.</p>

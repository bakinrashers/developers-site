They have established their own areas of knowledge and expertise but are willing to share what they know and are always eager to learn new things.</p><p>They are humble and moderate in their views. Happy to mentor a junior developer, capable of leading a team or supporting one of their peers to deliver a shared technical vision. They see the world in terms of potential solutions, not problems. They support their opinions with data and metrics rather than rhetoric. They find out how to delight our journalists and readers and deliver the things that really matter to our organisation.</p>"

      "description": "<p>Guardian News & Media Ltd. is seeking a technical, motivated and open minded colleague to join our highly respected, but relaxed Digital Development team as a Software Engineer - tools, automation, process.  You’ll be pivotal in helping shape the culture of a product team, and in embedding quality throughout the whole process of software development. As well as leading the development of innovative automated solutions to improve our products’ quality, you’ll be finding and researching new techniques and tools and leading discussion with the team about how and where we can use them</p> <p>We are not looking for someone whose ambition is to spend vast amounts of time creating and maintaining automated UI tests. We are looking someone who is excited at the prospect of getting the whole team thinking about quality, by suggesting and developing automated solutions and tooling to facilitate this, but also about having the time to think more creatively about things that might influence the quality of our products. Here at the Guardian we are redefining the traditional approach to QA: relying less on traditional manual and automated UI testing processes; instead ensuring overall product quality through improving automation, tooling, and process - within an agile team operating under rapid deployment cycles.</p>"

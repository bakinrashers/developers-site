                <h1>Join the Guardian&rsquo;s Development Team</h1>
                <p>We’re committed to a digital-first strategy, and in order to
                achieve this, we’re expanding our team of developers.</p>

                    <p>We need people who love a challenge and are willing
                    to successfully take on difficult tasks, contribute to
                    their team and learn on the job. Our engineers enjoy
                    learning and sharing what they learn and they get to
                    work on some unique challenges.</p> <p>We work in
                    cross-functional agile teams that we trust to take on the
                    problems and objectives that they are given. All
                    development is based in London in the same offices as
                    our journalists and editors.</p>

            <p>The Guardian aims to ensure that all job applicants are treated fairly regardless of race (which includes nationality and ethnic or national origin), disability, sex, gender re-assignment, marital or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, perceived or actual age, maternity, pregnancy and religion or belief.</p>

            <p>Some of the benefits that the Guardian can provide for employees include annual season ticket loan, childcare assistance vouchers, cycle to work scheme, gym membership and holiday purchase scheme. We also have a Pension scheme and some of our team work flexible hours - this is agreed on a case by case basis.</p>

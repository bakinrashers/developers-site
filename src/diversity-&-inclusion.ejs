                                    <p>Flexible working can create a range of employment opportunities
                                        to suit both changing operational needs and the needs of individuals.
                                        It can also increase employment opportunities for anyone with caring
                                        responsibilities who are unable to work full time. We recognise the
                                        importance of flexible working as part of its wider commitment to diversity
                                        and equality in the workplace.

                                        between parents after their child is born up until the child’s first birthday.
                                        It provides parents with more choice around how they balance their caregiving
                                        responsibilities and can help to improve diversity and inclusion in the

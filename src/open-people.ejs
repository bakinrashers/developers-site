                <p>Our culture of openness around people and processes gives us a common understanding of what we value.
                    It enables us to challenge and improve everything we do.  Although these don't change as often as
                    our source code, they do need to change as the team does.</p>

                                    <p>We use this internally to ensure every engineer in the department understands
                                        our career progression process, and for that process to be clear and consistent to everyone.<br>
                                        There may seem to be a lot of detail there, but this is because we take a lot of
                                        effort to make it fair and consistent.
